# stats-ci

[![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE.md)

NB: As probably obvious from the `0.0.x` version number, this crate is currently in a very unstable state and any commit can poissibly introduce breaking changes. At this stage, I am making no efforts of backward compatibility. Therefore, please use at your own risks at least until a version `0.x`. 

## Description

Stats-ci provides some basic functions to compute confidence intervals of sample data.
This includes confidence intervals around the mean for numerical data, confidence intervals around a quantile (e.g., median) for arbitrary ordered data, and confidence intervals for proprotions.

## Usage

Add the most recent release to your `Cargo.toml`

```Rust
[dependencies]
stats-ci = "0.0.1"
```

## Examples

## Contributing

I will gladly and carefully consider any constructive comments that you have to offer.
In particular, I will be considering constructive feedback both on the interface and the calculations
with the following priorities correctness, code readability, genericity, efficiency.
